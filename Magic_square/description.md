A "magic square" is a matrix of numbers of n x n dimensions whose columns, rows, and diagonals all sum to the same number. 
For example:

	8 1 6
	3 5 7
	4 9 2

This script reads numeric input from the magicData.txt file and calculates whether the numbers form a magic square. The program 
returns a report for each square along with a final conclusion, like the one below.

	***** Square 1 *****
	Sum of row: 15
	Sum of row: 15
	Sum of row: 15
	Column Sum: 15
	Column Sum: 15
	Column Sum: 15
	First diagonal sum: 15
	Second diagonal sum: 15
	This is a magic square
